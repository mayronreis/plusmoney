## About 
It is an application for financial control. The user can post the expense and income information during the month.
Category filters can help the user to identify where most of the spending comes from and where most of the money comes from.

The basis of this application was developed during the React Native course offered by Dev Samurai (https://devsamurai.com.br/).

## Challenges
This was the first application I developed in React Native. The initial challenges were to understand how the React Native library worked, to understand its proposal and to start to develop effectively.

Understanding the basic concepts and applying good programming practices is easy to adapt to the environment.

Another challenge was to manipulate data with databases. Realm and Firebase were used and the proposal of the two databases had to be studied to abstract the concepts in the best possible way.

What was more complicated was the resolution of several environmental errors. When a new library was installed, some simple mistakes made me lose a lot of time.

## Motivation

The purpose of this application was to learn a little about React Native. It is a library that provides the development of applications for Android and IOS. I have always been interested in developing mobile applications and found React Native the perfect opportunity.
